Github Issues are not a discussion forum, and they are not a place to share nifty ideas for new features or to ask for help.  Not being able to connect to Brandmeister or weird Brandmeister behavior for example, is not a valid issue. Any of these type of issues will be deleted and if repeated, the user will be blocked.

To report a valid bug, you must be running the latest git and build from source and launch from a terminal window.  You must then provide a clear step-by-step example of how to reproduce the bug and include the output from the terminal window when reproducing the bug.  All settings you have entered must be included.

If your issue fits these requirements, then delete this text and submit your issue.
